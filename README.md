A little test to get a model to anticipate new values based on preliminary data 



```X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]) ```


```Y = np.array([8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 8, 9, 12, 16, 17, 17])```

And this is the model obtained after a lots of calculations to get the slope and y-intercept
